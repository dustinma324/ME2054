Dear ME 2054 Student,

If you are reading this message, it means you know how to copy a file to 
a remote machine securely and extract a compressed tarball. Congratulations!
But there is more to do to finish this quiz! 

I want you to use a Linux command to view all the processes currently 
running on the H2P cluster at CRC. Give it a try. There should be so many processes.
Some don't belong to you.

Now use a SINGLE line of commands to extract all the processes that contain your 
username and append it to file "result.txt" that came with the tarball.
Do NOT lose the existing contents in result.txt

Once you achieve the above task. Type the command that you used to achieve the 
above task at the end of the result.txt file.

Rename result.txt as yourLastName_quiz1.txt and upload it to your Box directory for the class
